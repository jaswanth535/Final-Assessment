                    <p>Responsive design is the term that describes flexibility, which means if we write proper 
                    code for once and it makes the page look greater everywhere. For example, the code we have 
                    written on the computer makes look good in it and it also has to look good on iPad, iPhones, 
                    and android mobiles as well. The Responsive design brings a lot of changes to the website based 
                    on the size of a screen and also the device by which we are using to view the website. So, this 
                    responsive design mainly responds to the screen size that we are viewing. So instead of creating 
                    a lot of different websites for different devices our responsive design rearranges the elements to 
                    fit in any screen and by doing so weâ€™ll get more visitors and that also leads to more happy 
                    customers. The one language that makes responsive design easier is CSS. We can always add 
                    responsive later but it will be a lot more effective than if we add it at the beginning itself. 
                    So finally, we can tell that responsive design is writing code once to make our website look great.</p> 

                    <p>One way to create a proper responsive design is by using media queries. So, these media queries allow 
                    us to create CSS rules based on different parameters like size, viewport, device type, etc. So, we can 
                    arrange our layout to suit a different variety of screen sizes or devices.  We can create a media query 
                    that targets just mobile screen sizes and we can also create a whole set of CSS rules that are going to 
                    target screen sizes. We can include these media queries in the CSS that we are using. While designing the 
                    websites and designed I have learned few things that are defining the problem before solving, and also 
                    preparing the workflow before building a web page, preparing a prototype for my web page, working on the 
                    design that I have prepared already(prototype), testing the webpage that I have designed and making it 
                    responsive to the users. While building web applications or websites we need to make some choices first. 
                    According to my point of view it is easy to build fully responsive sites and it can be described in two 
                    steps and they are defining the architecture information and page structure and the second step is adding 
                    design elements to make it responsive and to bring better look for the page that we design.

                    Finally, from the WEB222 course, I have learned a lot of things that are related to front-end technologies mainly HTML, 
                    CSS, JS. I have also learned some client web programming topics such as menu bar and navigations, images, 
                    HTML forms, hyperlinks, responsive layout for mobile devices, events, DOM modifications, etc. Overall, I 
                    have learned to develop basic and strong web applications to present standards and practices and also 
                    learned proper utilization of javascript, which provides interacting web applications. By learning CSS, 
                    I have learned to provide a good appearance of webpages and applications and HTML5 is a markup language 
                    that helped me to create electronic documents. Finally, I had a great learning experience and got a good 
                    knowledge of concepts provided in the course.</p>
